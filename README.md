### Disclaimer
This repository holds a collection of Phishing Kits used by criminals to steal informations. Almost every file into the `raw` folder is malicious so I strongly recommend you to neither open these files, nor misuse the code to prank your friends. Playing with these kits may lead to irreversible consequences which may affect anything from personal data to passwords and banking information.

**I am not responsible for any damage caused by the malware inside my repository and your negligence in general.**

### NB: Large File System Hahead
PhishingKitTracker is stored into Git Large File System (git-lfs) due to the big amount of data tracked. You *should* install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) first.
